# classmotorsmcr

This is a mess. I am aware.

 contains directories relevent to classmotorsmcr bot development

 figuring out how to use github sorry if this is shitty.

 some of the python files have commented logs at the top.

 Anyway, welcome.

 This set of scripts allows for automatic web scraping and the automation of 
 car evaluation.

 \passive_lead_bot\ - once running it will stick to daily schedules that
 pull and evalutate newly listed cars.

 \active_bot\ - once running this waits for discord input to evaluate a registration number.
